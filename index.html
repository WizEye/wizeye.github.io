    <h2>Project #1: WizEye</h2>
    <p><img src="http://celtra.com/media/uploads/_custom/blog/wizeye.jpg" alt="Wizeye" width="500" height="216" border="0"></p>
    <p>WizEye is a service that continuously monitors the visual part of an application. The process involves automated comparison of an easily generated reference state of the application against newly formed style sheets (CSS).</p>
    <p>The initial idea of WizEye was really ambitious, therefore we are super pleased to have a working prototype in place as we are concluding the project.</p>
    <p>Example of WizEye in use:</p>
